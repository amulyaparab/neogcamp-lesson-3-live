      ‘Viruses are dreadful’ we can all agree upon this statement after the
      covid-19 pandemic. Lives were lost, many were laid off from their jobs,
      mental health toppled down, and numerous other terrible consequences. But
      there is a saying that what is bad must have at least a few specks of good
      and what is good must have at least a few specks of bad. Is this true in
      the case of viruses too? Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Viruses are tiny particles having genetic material within and wearing a
      protein coat outside. Every organism on our Earth has its own specific
      virus. Viruses can infect Animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and even
      viruses themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Our universe was crafted in a way that good and bad cannot be separated
      beyond a certain extent. Anyone can walk through the good and must I even
      mention how good we humans are at nit-picking every little fault in the
      best. The difficult part is to walk through the bad and find the good. The
      covid-19 pandemic was the same, most of it a black desert with only a few
      silver linings like the betterment of the environment, the productivity
      boost in some people’s lives, the awareness of vaccines, and the awareness
      about mental health.

      <strong> Viruses are a part of us:</strong> Viruses are a part of the
      human microbiome. Most of us know there are good bacteria just like
      pathogenic bacteria. But did you know there are good viruses too? These
      form an important part of our microbiome and don’t harm us but rather may
      safeguard our health. Some retroviruses are involved in creating the first
      immunity barriers in a fetus. Retroviruses are ancient viruses that have
      been transmitted through genes over many many generations.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      <strong>Vaccines:</strong> Viruses are useful to make vaccines. Vaccines
      like smallpox, polio, and MMR vaccines have been some of the most
      successful vaccines to be made. One might argue that ‘Vaccines are the
      correction of the harmful virus’ own wrongdoing. If it did not exist we
      would not need the particular vaccine. But we must know no one’s greater
      than nature and we must appreciate what we have instead of thinking about
      what we do not. Researchers work hard to provide us with these protective
      shields and must be appreciated for their efforts. The only human disease
      to be eradicated completely is Smallpox, this was the first-ever vaccine
      and it was made from the Cowpox virus which caused almost no harm to
      humans. Although Smallpox and Cowpox viruses are related, the Cowpox virus
      was a real breakthrough and very beneficial for us humans.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      <strong> Research:</strong> Viruses are an integral part of biological
      study. A lot of our present knowledge of genes, immunology,
      nanotechnology, biotechnology, and molecular biology is a gift from
      viruses. Advancements in these fields require viruses for various purposes
      like gene rearrangement, genetic cloning, as vectors, and so on. Research
      is incomplete without viruses.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      <strong>Evolution:</strong> An extremely interesting fact is that a
      whopping 8% of our human genome comes from ancient retroviral genes which
      have transferred as an infection between evolving species. For example, we
      share these retroviruses with chimpanzees. These retroviruses are a pillar
      of evidence of human evolution from chimpanzees. Some other theories claim
      that a virus could have been the first organism to have existed but
      nothing about the first-ever organism is for sure.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      <strong>Phage Therapy:</strong> The most useful viruses for us are
      bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and will
      not harm humans. Phage therapy is based on the principle that
      bacteriophages will infect and kill specific harmful bacteria and give us
      relief from these harmful bacteria. So bacteriophages can be an
      alternative to antibiotics. Research is underway but bacteriophages have
      some advantages over antibiotics. Bacteria can find ways to defend
      themselves against antibiotics and bacteriophages. This is called
      developing resistance against antibiotics/ bacteriophages. That is why old
      antibiotics are often ineffective against bacteria and there is pressure
      to discover new ones. So what advantage do bacteriophages have over
      antibiotics? Unlike antibiotics, bacteriophages can develop new ways to
      infect bacteria. Both bacteria and bacteriophage will evolve and thus
      bacteria would not be able to become permanently resistant to these.

      There are many more ways viruses are useful to us, like virophages used to
      kill larger viruses, and how they could be our next solution to Cancer
      using nanotechnology. You can learn more about it here:

      Viruses as dreadful as they are, it is humanity that has to choose whether
      to keep them categorized as bad or to find the good!
