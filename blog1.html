      It is as beautiful a phenomenon as it is a word! Let’s ignite our minds.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      What is Bioluminescence? As the word says (bio: living, luminescence:
      light), it is the light generated by living organisms. These living
      creatures can create their own otherworldly light! The most common example
      of this is the fireflies. We all have awe towards these little creatures
      that produce light and it is a delightful feast for the eyes.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Do you know where you can find millions of creatures like these? The
      answer is: At the depths of the oceans! Yes, you heard correctly. When we
      look at oceans we picture a gloomy bottomless dark pit. But the truth is
      that if you peek deep below you will find the most beautiful luminescent
      sights ever. There are jellyfishes, algae, bacteria, fishes, seahorses,
      squids, corals, starfishes, and even sharks that show this phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Bioluminescence is an evolved strategy that is used by all these
      organisms. Fireflies use it to attract mates, fishes use it to attract
      prey while some simply use it to see in the dark because sunlight wouldn’t
      penetrate that deep into the opaque oceans, right? So you need a body that
      works as a flashlight itself.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Now one would say, ‘Bioluminescence sounds like a heart-capturing
      phenomenon Amulya, but how in the world would I go deep diving into
      oceans? It seems kinda inaccessible.’ Well, then I have another way for
      you!
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Imagine you are at the beach and blue fairy lights light up the complete
      bay, seems beautiful doesn’t it? But what if they are ‘living’ fairy
      lights? Yes, they exist! These microscopic creatures are called
      dinoflagellates. They are seen as tiny fluorescent blue lights when the
      water moves at night. These beaches look so beautiful in photos that I
      have them on my ‘must-visit’ list! And in my not-so-esteemed opinion,
      everyone should. And if you live in India then be surprised, there’s a
      bioluminescent beach in Mumbai!
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      Here’s a link to finding these:

    <p class="align center-container">
      So how do these organisms produce light? What is it that they do so
      differently than us? Unlike most organisms we see on Earth these creatures
      can glow in the dark. This is because inside their body certain chemical
      reactions take place that can produce light. So bioluminescence is a
      byproduct of chemiluminescence (light produced by chemicals) inside a
      biological body. The most predominant chemical in most of these reactions
      is ‘luciferin’. Luciferin means ‘light bearer’. It reacts with an enzyme
      called ‘luciferase’ in the presence of oxygen and energy(ATP) to produce
      light. There are other chemicals like these too, but luciferin-luciferase
      is the most popular of them all.

    <p class="align center-container">
      Except for all the marine creatures there are even other terrestrial
      creatures like worms and fungi that show bioluminescence.
    </p>
    <p class="align center-container">
      In this deep world of light, there’s still an ocean to be uncovered.
      Scientists are now using genes from bioluminescent bacteria to genetically
      modify normal organisms into light-producers. Maybe soon we will have
      organic trees that shine like street lights. Our Earth is as fascinating
      as it gets.
